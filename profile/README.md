日本語版はこちら [README_JP.md](README_JP.md).

**Karakuri Agent** is an open-source project aiming to create an **AI agent** accessible from any environment—whether it's a smart speaker, chat tool, or web application. By integrating various endpoints and services, it aims to realize a world where you can **access a single agent** from **anywhere**.  
You can also define multiple agents simultaneously, each with unique roles, personalities, voices, and models.
